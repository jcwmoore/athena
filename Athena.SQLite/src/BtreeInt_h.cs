		**
		** This file implements a external (disk-based) database using BTrees.
		** For a detailed discussion of BTrees, refer to
		**
		**     Donald E. Knuth, THE ART OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, Volume 3:
		**     "Sorting And Searching", pages 473-480. Addison-Wesley
		**     Publishing Company, Reading, Massachusetts.
		**
		** The basic idea is that each page of the file contains N database
		** entries and N+1 pointers to subpages.
		**
		**   ----------------------------------------------------------------
		**   |  Ptr(0) | Key(0) | Ptr(1) | Key(1) | ... | Key(N-1) | Ptr(N) |
		**   ----------------------------------------------------------------
		**
		** All of the keys on the page that Ptr(0) points to have values less
		** than Key(0).  All of the keys on page Ptr(1) and its subpages have
		** values greater than Key(0) and less than Key(1).  All of the keys
		** on Ptr(N) and its subpages have values greater than Key(N-1).  And
		** so forth.
		**
		** Finding a particular key requires reading O(log(M)) pages from the
		** disk where M is the number of entries in the tree.
		**
		** In this implementation, a single file can hold one or more separate
		** BTrees.  Each BTree is identified by the index of its root page.  The
		** key and data for any entry are combined to form the "payload".  A
		** fixed amount of payload can be carried directly on the database
		** page.  If the payload is larger than the preset amount then surplus
		** bytes are stored on overflow pages.  The payload for an entry
		** and the preceding pointer are combined to form a "Cell".  Each
		** page has a small header which contains the Ptr(N) pointer and other
		** information such as the size of key and data.
		**
		** FORMAT DETAILS
		**
		** The file is divided into pages.  The first page is called page 1,
		** the second is page 2, and so forth.  A page number of zero indicates
		** "no such page".  The page size can be any power of 2 between 512 and 65536.
		** Each page can be either a btree page, a freelist page, an overflow
		** page, or a pointer-map page.
		**
		** The first page is always a btree page.  The first 100 bytes of the first
		** page contain a special header (the "file header") that describes the file.
		** The format of the file header is as follows:
		**
		**   OFFSET   SIZE    DESCRIPTION
		**      0      16     Header string: "SQLite format 3\000"
		**     16       2     Page size in bytes.
		**     18       1     File format write version
		**     19       1     File format read version
		**     20       1     Bytes of unused space at the end of each page
		**     21       1     Max embedded payload fraction
		**     22       1     Min embedded payload fraction
		**     23       1     Min leaf payload fraction
		**     24       4     File change counter
		**     28       4     Reserved for future use
		**     32       4     First freelist page
		**     36       4     Number of freelist pages in the file
		**     40      60     15 4-byte meta values passed to higher layers
		**
		**     40       4     Schema cookie
		**     44       4     File format of schema layer
		**     48       4     Size of page cache
		**     52       4     Largest root-page (auto/incr_vacuum)
		**     56       4     1=UTF-8 2=UTF16le 3=UTF16be
		**     60       4     User version
		**     64       4     Incremental vacuum mode
		**     68       4     unused
		**     72       4     unused
		**     76       4     unused
		**
		** All of the integer values are big-endian (most significant byte first).
		**
		** The file change counter is incremented when the database is changed
		** This counter allows other processes to know when the file has changed
		** and thus when they need to flush their cache.
		**
		** The max embedded payload fraction is the amount of the total usable
		** space in a page that can be consumed by a single cell for standard
		** B-tree (non-LEAFDATA) tables.  A value of 255 means 100%.  The default
		** is to limit the maximum cell size so that at least 4 cells will fit
		** on one page.  Thus the default max embedded payload fraction is 64.
		**
		** If the payload for a cell is larger than the max payload, then extra
		** payload is spilled to overflow pages.  Once an overflow page is allocated,
		** as many bytes as possible are moved into the overflow pages without letting
		** the cell size drop below the min embedded payload fraction.
		**
		** The min leaf payload fraction is like the min embedded payload fraction
		** except that it applies to leaf nodes in a LEAFDATA tree.  The maximum
		** payload fraction for a LEAFDATA tree is always 100% (or 255) and it
		** not specified in the header.
		**
		** Each btree pages is divided into three sections:  The header, the
		** cell pointer array, and the cell content area.  Page 1 also has a 100-byte
		** file header that occurs before the page header.
		**
		**      |----------------|
		**      | file header    |   100 bytes.  Page 1 only.
		**      |----------------|
		**      | page header    |   8 bytes for leaves.  12 bytes for interior nodes
		**      |----------------|
		**      | cell pointer   |   |  2 bytes per cell.  Sorted order.
		**      | array          |   |  Grows downward
		**      |                |   v
		**      |----------------|
		**      | unallocated    |
		**      | space          |
		**      |----------------|   ^  Grows upwards
		**      | cell content   |   |  Arbitrary order interspersed with freeblocks.
		**      | area           |   |  and free space fragments.
		**      |----------------|
		**
		** The page headers looks like this:
		**
		**   OFFSET   SIZE     DESCRIPTION
		**      0       1      Flags. 1: intkey, 2: zerodata, 4: leafdata, 8: leaf
		**      1       2      byte offset to the first freeblock
		**      3       2      number of cells on this page
		**      5       2      first byte of the cell content area
		**      7       1      number of fragmented free bytes
		**      8       4      Right child (the Ptr(N) value).  Omitted on leaves.
		**
		** The flags define the format of this btree page.  The leaf flag means that
		** this page has no children.  The zerodata flag means that this page carries
		** only keys and no data.  The intkey flag means that the key is a integer
		** which is stored in the key size entry of the cell header rather than in
		** the payload area.
		**
		** The cell pointer array begins on the first byte after the page header.
		** The cell pointer array contains zero or more 2-byte numbers which are
		** offsets from the beginning of the page to the cell content in the cell
		** content area.  The cell pointers occur in sorted order.  The system strives
		** to keep free space after the last cell pointer so that new cells can
		** be easily added without having to defragment the page.
		**
		** Cell content is stored at the very end of the page and grows toward the
		** beginning of the page.
		**
		** Unused space within the cell content area is collected into a linked list of
		** freeblocks.  Each freeblock is at least 4 bytes in size.  The byte offset
		** to the first freeblock is given in the header.  Freeblocks occur in
		** increasing order.  Because a freeblock must be at least 4 bytes in size,
		** any group of 3 or fewer unused bytes in the cell content area cannot
		** exist on the freeblock chain.  A group of 3 or fewer free bytes is called
		** a fragment.  The total number of bytes in all fragments is recorded.
		** in the page header at offset 7.
		**
		**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
		**      2     Byte offset of the next freeblock
		**      2     Bytes in this freeblock
		**
		** Cells are of variable length.  Cells are stored in the cell content area at
		** the end of the page.  Pointers to the cells are in the cell pointer array
		** that immediately follows the page header.  Cells is not necessarily
		** contiguous or in order, but cell pointers are contiguous and in order.
		**
		** Cell content makes use of variable length integers.  A variable
		** length integer is 1 to 9 bytes where the lower 7 bits of each
		** byte are used.  The integer consists of all bytes that have bit 8 set and
		** the first byte with bit 8 clear.  The most significant byte of the integer
		** appears first.  A variable-length integer may not be more than 9 bytes long.
		** As a special case, all 8 bytes of the 9th byte are used as data.  This
		** allows a 64-bit integer to be encoded in 9 bytes.
		**
		**    0x00                      becomes  0x00000000
		**    0x7f                      becomes  0x0000007f
		**    0x81 0x00                 becomes  0x00000080
		**    0x82 0x00                 becomes  0x00000100
		**    0x80 0x7f                 becomes  0x0000007f
		**    0x8a 0x91 0xd1 0xac 0x78  becomes  0x12345678
		**    0x81 0x81 0x81 0x81 0x01  becomes  0x10204081
		**
		** Variable length integers are used for rowids and to hold the number of
		** bytes of key and data in a btree cell.
		**
		** The content of a cell looks like this:
		**
		**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
		**      4     Page number of the left child. Omitted if leaf flag is set.
		**     var    Number of bytes of data. Omitted if the zerodata flag is set.
		**     var    Number of bytes of key. Or the key itself if intkey flag is set.
		**      *     Payload
		**      4     First page of the overflow chain.  Omitted if no overflow
		**
		** Overflow pages form a linked list.  Each page except the last is completely
		** filled with data (pagesize - 4 bytes).  The last page can have as little
		** as 1 byte of data.
		**
		**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
		**      4     Page number of next overflow page
		**      *     Data
		**
		** Freelist pages come in two subtypes: trunk pages and leaf pages.  The
		** file header points to the first in a linked list of trunk page.  Each trunk
		** page points to multiple leaf pages.  The content of a leaf page is
		** unspecified.  A trunk page looks like this:
		**
		**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
		**      4     Page number of next trunk page
		**      4     Number of leaf pointers on this page
		**      *     zero or more pages numbers of leaves
