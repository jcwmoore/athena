athena
======

Every good developer should have one of these, this is my personal library of helpers and odds and ends that I find myself using all the time in work and personal projects.

Ioc
======
Why another IoC container?  Well I didn't really care for any of the ones out there under the MIT license and so I rolled my own out of a need and a desire to better understand IOC.  Use it if you like, otherwise I don't really care.

SQLite
======
SQLite libraries are my personal clone of the csharp-sqlite (http://code.google.com/p/csharp-sqlite/) project.  I have added an Android build and added an entity framework provider for the library.  Portions of the Entity Framework library fall under the MS-PL and/or public domain and are copy written by the person/organization noted in the code files.
